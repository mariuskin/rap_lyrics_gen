Ohh darling
Ohh darling
Ohh darling

It's 4 a.m. beneath the stars, under the night
And you're here, and you're here
Candles lit, the room is dark, the moon is light
We can lay here, we can love here

Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling
Ohh darling

I brought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine
And a blanket, we used them all
I dreamt a day away on a planet full of life
To stay there, fell in love there

Perfect comes near, perfect just for one
Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling, ohh love
Ohh darling, ohh love

Lying down, her cheek is resting on my shoulder
I play with her hair, I adore her
This is the single sweetest love I've ever known, yea
We could stay here, run away, dear

Love knows no fear, but it doubted some
Forever is all I ever want
So be careful when you're giving it to someone

Ohh darling, ohh love
Ohh darling, ohh love
