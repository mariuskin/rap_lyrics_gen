I found your hair band on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides
In my eyes
Never getting dry,
So I get high,
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night

I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall
With the head spin I got,
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

That's why you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever,
But I know that I never wanna settle down,
Come around, break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts
And I dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward
Like our last kiss. It was perfect,
But we were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant
Or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Wo-ooooahhhh [2x] oohh ohh

Because if I was gonna go somewhere,
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down
And I'm thinking that I'm unaware,
I keep my feet on the ground
And keep looking around
To make sure I'm not the only one to feel low

Because if you want,
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say
That I'm the only one,
But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
